# Consume the model

In this section you'll learn how to deploy the application to an ASP.NET Core Razor Pages application

One of the advantages of ML<i>.NET is you have different deployment targets. Perhaps you're used to building desktop, mobile and web applications in .NET. All of these are potential deployment targets for your model.

## Install Microsoft.Extensions.ML package

Install the `Microsoft.Extensions.ML` NuGet package to the `Web` project. Make sure to select version **1.5.0**.

Alternatively, you can use the dotnet cli

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.ML -v 1.5.0
```

During evaluation, we used the `Transform` method to make multiple predictions on the training and test dataset. The `Transform` method is a great way to make predictions on an entire `IDataView`. However, when you want to make a single prediction, you can use the `PredictionEngine` convenience API which takes in a single instance of an object used as your model's input. In this case, you can pass in a single `ModelInput` instance instead of having to create an `IDataView` for a single data point. A challenge with `PredictionEngine` though is that it's not thread-safe. As a result, when you want to scale `PredictionEngine` in multi-threaded environments, it's recommended that you use the `PredictionEnginePool` service that's part of the `Microsoft.Extensions.ML` NuGet package.

## Define model output schema

To access the prediction, define the schema of the output created by the model. In the *Shared* project, create a new class called `ModelOutput` with the `Score` property of type `float`. This property contains the output or predicted price generated by the model.

```csharp
public class ModelOutput
{
    public float Score { get; set; }
}
```

## Configure PredictionEnginePool service

The `PredictionEnginePool` is designed for use with dependency injection which is built into ASP.NET Core. As such, you configure it just like you would any other service you want to use throughout your application.

In the *Web* project, open the *Startup.cs* file and add the following `using` statements to the top to reference the *Shared* and *Microsoft.ML.Extensions* NuGet package.

```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.ML;
using Shared;
```

Then, in the `ConfigureServices` method, register the `PredictionEnginePool` service and use the path of where you saved your model.

```csharp
services.AddPredictionEnginePool<ModelInput, ModelOutput>().FromFile(@"C:\Dev\MLModel.zip");
```

In this case, the model was loaded from a file, but you can also load models stored remotely via publicly accessible endpoints using the `FromUri` method.

## Add PreditionEnginePool to Index PageModel

Open the *Pages/Index.cshtml.cs* file and add the following `using` statements at the top to reference the *Shared* project and `Microsoft.Extensions.ML` NuGet package:

```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.ML;
using Shared;
```

Inside the class, define a private readonly variable for the `PredictionEnginePool` service.

```csharp
private readonly PredictionEnginePool<ModelInput, ModelOutput> _predictionEnginePool;
```

Then, inject the `PredictionEnginePool` service into the `Index` constructor.

```csharp
public IndexModel(ILogger<IndexModel> logger, ICarModelService carFileModelService, PredictionEnginePool<ModelInput,ModelOutput> predictionEnginePool)
{
    _logger = logger;
    _carModelService = carFileModelService.GetDetails();
    CarMakeSL = new SelectList(_carModelService, "Id", "Model", default, "Make");
    _predictionEnginePool = predictionEnginePool;
}
```

Finally, replace the implementation of the `OnPost` method with the following.

```csharp
public void OnPost()
{
    var selectedMakeModel = _carModelService.Where(x => CarModelDetailId == x.Id).FirstOrDefault();

    CarInfo.Make = selectedMakeModel.Make;
    CarInfo.Model = selectedMakeModel.Model;

    ModelInput input = new ModelInput
    {
        Year = (float)CarInfo.Year,
        Mileage = (float)CarInfo.Mileage,
        Make = CarInfo.Make,
        Model = CarInfo.Model
    };

    ModelOutput prediction = _predictionEnginePool.Predict(input);
    CarInfo.Price = prediction.Score;
    ShowPrice = true;
}
```

In the snippet above, the information from the `CarInfo` model is taken and a new instance of `ModelInput` is created. Then, the `Predict` function is used to predict the price of a vehicle, given the inputs from the `input` variable. Once a prediction is made, the `Price` property of the `CarInfo` is set to the predicted value and the price is displayed on screen.

## Run the app

Set the startup project to `Web` and run the application. Fill in the form fields and select **Predict Price**.
