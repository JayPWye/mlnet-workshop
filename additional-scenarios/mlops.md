# MLOps

This section provides some information and resources on MLOps.

## What is MLOps

Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) is based on [DevOps](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) principles and practices that increase the efficiency of workflows. For example, continuous integration, delivery, and deployment. MLOps applies these principles to the machine learning process.

## Automate the ML lifecycle

Like DevOps, the MLOps lifecycle consists of the automation of several steps. This is typically done by some build system as part of a Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) pipeline. This provides full control over the entire model lifecyle. Training and deploying models using MLOps practices in addition to automating the process, it also provides auditability, transparency, and reproducibility.

### Train

Train: In a typical scenario, when data changes or a Data Scientist checks a change into the Git repo for a project, the build system will start a training run.

### Evaluate

Evaluate: The results of the run can then be inspected to see the performance characteristics of the trained model. This can be done using traditional methods like unit tests. If you have access to previous models that are in production or produced in previous runs, you can then evaluate the performance across various models to select the best one. 

### Deploy

Deploy: As part of the release pipeline you can also create a pipeline that deploys the model. Deployment can have multiple meanings. Deployment means publishing the validated production version of the model to a file share or blob storage to be accessed downstream from other end-user applications and services. .NET provides various deployment targets, so this could mean deploying the model inside of a desktop (WPF,UWP), web (Blazor, Razor Pages, Web API, Docker, Serverless),  Mobile*, and IoT* app as well.

*Deploying to ARM environments (IoT/Mobile) might require converting the model to ONNX.
